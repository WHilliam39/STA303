```

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
#Re-join all new features with unique employee ID:

other_subset <- current_employee[,c(1:3, 6)]
leadership <- other_subset %>% 
  group_by(employee_id) %>% count(leadership_for_level) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = leadership_for_level, values_from = n) 
leadership[is.na(leadership)] <- 0

other_subset <- other_subset[,c(1:3)]
other_subset <- distinct(other_subset)

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
#Fit model:
#fixed effects & random effects:
#number of promotions as outcome variable:
model_num_promote <- lme(num_promoted ~
                           gender+team+leadership_appropriate,
                         data=new_data,random = ~1|employee_id, method = "ML")
summary(model_num_promote)
```
Under the **Linear Mixed Effects Models**, we have build a model to describe the relationship between the number of promotion and average productivity, gender and team groups, and group by employees' ID. From the model, it illustrates that the number of promotion would decreased by 0.2867 point in average when the employee is female rather than male. In addition, the p-value in female group is 0.0000, which is much less than 0.05, it represents the female group has a significant effect in this model, and it provide a strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (everyone has the equal oppotunity on promotions)

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
model_promote_productivity<- lme(num_promoted~
                             gender+team+leadership_appropriate+avg_productivity,
                           data=new_data,random = ~1|employee_id, method = "ML")
summary(model_promote_productivity)
```
Under this liner mixed effect model, it adds a new variable to show the effect on whether the employees's leadership ability is exceed thant the requirments of the level to the oppotunity to promoted. From this model, the women group also has a less number of promotion than the men, but the p-value of this effect is much greater than 0.05, which is 0.8202. Then this effect is not significant to determine this model.

```{r}
lrtest(model_num_promote,model_promote_productivity)
```
By using the likelihood ratio test, we can find that the likelihood ratio Chi-Squared statistic and the p-value is greater than 0.05, which is 0.07373, it represents the average productivity is not an impantant effect when the employees have the chance to promote. On the other hand, from the boxpolt result between gender and productivity, it shows that the mean of productivity in female group is higher than the male group. After combine the two results, the female group perhaps has few number of promotion and less oppotunity to promot than the male.

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
