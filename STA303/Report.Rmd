# Technical report
_This part of the report is much more comprehensive than the executive summary. The audience is statistics/data-minded people, but you should NOT include code or unformatted R output here._


## Introduction

_Provide a brief introduction to your report and outline what the report will cover. This section is valuable for setting scope and expectations. _

### Research questions:
_Use bullet points to to describe the research questions you are going to address. Write in full sentences._

* _Q1_
* _Q2_
* _Q3_

## Informative title for section addressing a research question (question 1 Hiring)

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

### Strengths and limitations

# Consultant information
## Consultant profiles

*Complete this section with a brief bio for each member of your group. If you are completing the project individually, you only need to complete one for yourself. In that case, change the title of this section to 'Consultant profile' instead. Examples below. This section is only marked for completeness, clarity and professionalism, not 'truth' so you can write it as if we're a few years in the future. Put your current degree in as completed and/or add your first choice grad school program, whatever you like. What skills related skills would you most like to highlight? What job title do you want?*

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
*	_Be very careful not to just copy and paste from these other documents! Put things in your own words._
